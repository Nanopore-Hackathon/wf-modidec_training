# wf-modidec (Part2: Model training)

## Introduction
In this directory you find part 2 of the code from ModiDec. The scripts located in ./bin facilitate the model loading and training. You can find test data is the ./test folder of this repository.


### Functionality Overview
Below is a graphical overview of suggested routes through the pipeline depending on the desired output.

## Guideline

1. Get your system up and ready
    - Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=23.10.0`)
    - Install [`Miniconda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

    - Install [`Docker`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

    - Install [`Epi2Me Desktop`](https://labs.epi2me.io) (v5.1.14 or later)

    - Clone the Github repository (we recommend the GitHub Desktop client)


2. Translate the functions and logic into Nextflow processes and ultimately a Nextflow pipeline
    - Please check the repository wf-modidec_analysis to get some hints about the synthax and folder structure of an Epi2Me workflow
    - Extract the variables that will be needed to train the network (have a look in ./bin/Training_NN_GUI.py)
    - Define a set variable names that will occur in all the scripts (e.g. nextflow_schema.json, ./bin/Training_NN_GUI.py)
    - Remove GUI features from ./bin/Training_NN_GUI.py and implement a script that can be started via command line tool. We recommend implementing an argparser.
    - Implement a process in main.nf, that takes all necessary variables as input and starts the changed ./bin/Training_NN.py script. Check which files you want to write to the filesystem and define them in the output section. Define a PublishDir to write the models to your filesystem. Assign the label modidec to the process. 
    - Implement a workflow in main.nf which calls the defined process and assign the right input variables to it.
    - Define a test config.yaml file to test the code without running it in Epi2Me. Take the config.yaml of the wf-modidec_analysis repository as template. 
    - In nextflow.config assign a label to the Docker container "stegiopast/modidec:latest" to enable the modidec label feature. (check wf-modidec_analysis/nextflow.config) 
    - Test if the pipeline runs through, when starting it via console. (nextflow run main.nf -params-file config.yaml) Test data can be found in folder ./bin/data/

3. Convert the GUI into nextflow_schema.json format for Epi2Me integration
    - Define the datatype and description for each variable that needs to be taken as input for the nextflow pipeline.
    - make epi2melabs/workflows/modidec directory 
    - Copy the wf-modidec_training repositroy into epi2melabs/workflows/modidec
    - Open Epi2Me and check if the repository occurs in the workflow section  


5. Test and debug pipeline in Epi2Me using test data
